There is public by default, secret by default and magi

For Each turn for Each Realm
we have different secret

hiddenRealms
hiddenMajorMaps
hiddenNarratives
etc...

realms, majormaps, narratives

constructs, locations, minormaps,
regions, regionsborders, features
heralds, items, kindred, religions
spelltype, unittype BuildLocationType

everything else remains secret by default,
but what about allied leaders, units and unitytpegroups?
how do they exchange and coordinate if they cant see each other? For that we probably need to add those.
But leave those for round2


resource (movement, mana, gp, ap, nfp, sfp, pwb, tv,
road(x2 land mv), resistance,
volcano, griphon_arie, elephant_farm, horse_farm, is_capital,

Q: The question is where these attributes belong?
for things like volcano, is_capital, home_region, religion, kindred, terrain_type, realm_type
they could be considered a resource where you have to have 1 as a cost
or they could be managed more particularly

cavQr, infQr, sgeQr, navQr, airQr, nsrQr, irQr, blQr, rsQr, celQr

cost

effect

extra_resources can do a set of named pairs of resource, ammount
